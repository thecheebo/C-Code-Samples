1. [Algorithms - 60 points (6 points each)].
(a) Explain how the middle node of a singly-linked list can be removed in constant time,
given a pointer to that node.

There could be a method within the singly-linked list that delete nodes where the pointer is
given that pointer always points to the one before by setting the node to be deleted to temp. Then
moving the pointers next node to the temp's next, thus repairing the chain. Then deleteing the node that 
was fed in as a parameter.


(b) In a “perfect” skiplist, we expect to never have to traverse forward more than one node
on any level. Why is this?
