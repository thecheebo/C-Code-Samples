Landmark Path Problem



Complexity to find shortest path, from 1 vertex to all others in directed weighted graph
O(m + n lg n)


For which one case below will Dijkstra's algorithm fail to produce a shortest path?

A connected graph with a cycle of negative weight edges.

Correct
Dijkstra's algorithm would continue to cycle through these negative edges, accumulating
a shorter path in terms of length as measured by edge weight path sum and would never terminate.
